Summary
For this assignment we measure the sale price variable of the Ames, IA Housing Testing data set. We first calculate the mean, sd deviation, median, minimum, maximum. Then we plot a histogram for the distribution of the sales price variable.
In Figure 2, we see the summary statistics of minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation. 
Mean of the sale price
Mean=177958 -> Interpretation: On average, the sale price is 177,958 for the Ames, IA Housing Testing.
Standard deviation of the sale price
Standard deviation=77569 -> Interpretation: On average, the sale price for the Ames, IA Housing deviates from the mean by about $77,569.
Median of the sale price
Median/Second Quartile/Q2=161750 -> Interpretation: Half the results for sale price are greater than or equal to 161,750, and half the results for sale price are less than or equal to 163995.
Minimum of the sale price
Minimum=52500 -> Interpretation: The smallest cost for the sale price is 52500.
Maximum of the sale price
Maximum=745000 -> Interpretation: The largest result cost for the sale price is 745000.
Histogram
In Figure 3 we see a histogram that shows the sale price on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. I could see the data is skewed right, and most of the homes cost $100,000 - $200,000. The number of houses sold with a sales price more than $200,000 decreases. 
Linear regression model
In Figure 4, we see that there's thirteen key factors marked with asterisks (*, **, ***), and it's evident that all thirteen displayed significance levels below the alpha value of 0.05.
Hypothesis
H0: There’s no significant difference as the sale price increases
H1: There’s a significant difference as the sale price increases 
The p-value is < 2.2e-16 (0.00000000000000022,) which is less than the significance factor of 0.05. We can reject the null hypothesis. The slope of the regression is 0.
During this assignment I was unsure if my interpretations were correct. Everything else went okay.
R-squared
84.7% of the variability of the dependent variable is explained by the regression model
MAPE 
At the bottom of Figure 4 we see that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 15.03981, which means predictions are, on average, off by 15% from the real values. 
While working on this assignment, the major issue I had was with the section multiple regression and interpretations.
